Debugging:
    Validation:
        Bindless handles
        Implementation defined/undefined behaviour
        Functions not allowed in current OpenGL profile/version
        Using extensions without explicitly enabling them
        Texture formats not natively supported on some GPUs
        Uninitialized uniforms
        Uninitialized textures
        Uninitialized buffers
    Asynchronous replaying
    Object viewing
        samplers
        program pipelines
        program uniforms
        large buffers
    Shader debugger
        Can use SSBOs
        Possible without by rendering the values to the framebuffer
            Use this because it works on more hardware and driver combinations

    Backtraces with line numbers for function calls
        Would significantly increase size of traces
        Should disable by default
        May not implement in favor of debug markers
    Debug markers and stuff
    State inspection
        Currently have lots though more still needed.
        Some duplicated state (glGetBooleanv and glIsEnabled calls getting the same state)
    Replay should check to see if the user supplied limits have been reached.

Tests:
    Compare expected objects with actual objects

Bugs:
    Program crashes with optimizations.
        Seems to be the glGetIntegerv calls in the state tracking code.
    Handle stuff like this: https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace/issues/5#issuecomment-1025742
    The state, textures, etc will not be updated when opening a trace in the GUI.
    The viewport at the first frame is incorrect.

Various TODOs in the source code.

Dramatically reduce memory usage and size of trace files.

Enum state values are not displayed as enums.

Cube map, 1D array, 2D array, rectangle, buffer, multisample, 1D and 3D textures.

Enabling or disabling state depending on OpenGL version and extensions.

glDel* should only flag the objects for deletion.

Control over the output trace filename in the GUI.

Control over the limits file in the GUI.

Multiple context support

Reduce memory usage during replaying.
    Reduce amount of memory needed to store state
