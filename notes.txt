Debugging:
    Validation:
        Bindless handles
        Implementation defined/undefined behaviour
        Errors
        Functions not allowed in current OpenGL profile/version
        Using extensions without explicitly enabling them
        Texture formats not natively supported on some GPUs
        Uninitialized uniforms
        Uninitialized textures
        Uninitialized buffers
        Unused uniforms
    View textures
    View meshes
    View state
    Shader debugger
        Can use SSBOs
        Possible without by rendering the values to the framebuffer
            Use this because it works on more hardware
    Backtraces with line numbers for function calls

Performance:
    CPU-GPU sync points
    Redundant and expensive state changes
        Not needed because the driver optimizes them out
    Statistics per function call and per frame
        Only get GPU time for calls with a context
    Slow paths
    Shader profiler
        Can use recent extensions (timers and SSBOs)
        Possible without but may not be reliable
