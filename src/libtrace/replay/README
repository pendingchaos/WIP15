The files in this directory are concatenated and then preprocessed before compilation.

The files contain what appears to be labels except they are outside function implementations.

At each of these labels, the following indented code is used to create a function which replays the function specified by the label name.

The result of the preprocessing is written to the file "replay_gl.c" in src/libtrace/.
